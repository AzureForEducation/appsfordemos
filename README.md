# Apps For Demos
By working with customers and presenting how Azure Services works on a regular basis, sometimes we do need to create applications which widely uses certain features of Azure Services. It is very helpful to land concepts rather to only present miraculous PPTs.

So we've decided to create this repository to concentrate these apps we are using on demos all around the World for you as well. You can take advantage of it by have them on your own presentations and even to study some aspects of it.

Enjoy!
